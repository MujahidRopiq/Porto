## Key Features

- Shopping cart with persistent storage
- User authentication
- Product search and filtering
- Payment processing with Stripe
- Admin dashboard for product management

## Challenges & Solutions

The main challenge was implementing real-time inventory updates across multiple users. I solved this by using MongoDB's transaction support to ensure data consistency.
